# JavaScript-training
This repository contains JS training exercises for Zero to Mastery Web Developer course and Advanced JavaScript course.

Why am I learning Web development?
I began my learning with Python and when my training moved to Flask I realized I want to have wider understanding -> FULL STACK understanding of software development. I wanted more than Flask was offering, so I started getting better understand about HTML and CSS at first, and now JavaScript.
